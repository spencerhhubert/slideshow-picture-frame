# slideshow-picture-frame

it's for a photo frame, except instead of a photo, there's a screen that does a slideshow.

I would like to use somthing like this https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader so that new photos can be added by my non techy family members through an icloud folder. then it just syncs to the local sd card, which can also be manually updated with new pictures.

the hard part will be actually making the frame lol
